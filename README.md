# Visualized Chord Generator AI
This is a demonstration of my experiment in letting my computer create a musically sound, well-presented chord progression.

#### Background Info 
Music generation is a fast-growing field, and modern approaches apply complex deep learning architectures to improve the generation quality. While the result is astonishing, I personally had opinions towards deep learning such as:
- Implicit nature of the models
- the usual lack of musical insights stemming from the statistical/probabilistic approaches
- affordability (my computer spec, training cost, etc.)

I wanted to experiment with different approaches along with deep learning models; one of my ideas was to separate the note generation from chord generation. 

#### How does it work
##### Chord-symbol-to-midi AI
I implemented an algorithm that outputs computer-generated MIDI file based on string input of chord progressions.

##### Automating chord progression output
I have used OpenAI API to let the system come up with its own chord progression, so that
